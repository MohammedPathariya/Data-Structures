    "Advanced Formula -> M = L + ((R-L) // 2). Same principle, but witten in this way to avoid integer overflow. This is a case when the two numbers (L,R) are too big themselves, and then we do some addition or multiplication operations on them, increasing the mumber further. So using the advance formula is the best practice."

    "Imagine you are playing a role-playing video game where your character’s power level determines whether you can defeat a particular boss. If your power level is too low, every attempt fails no matter how many times you try. Once you reach a certain threshold, however, you are always able to win. This creates a very clear boundary: below some level it’s impossible, and at or above that level victory is guaranteed. If you plotted all possible power levels against “can I win?”, it would look like [False, False, False, …, True, True, True…], just like the array in your binary search condition example. Instead of testing every power level one by one, which could take forever if the range is large, you can use condition-based binary search to quickly home in on the first “True” point — the minimum power needed to succeed. At each step you test the midpoint power level, simulate or check whether it beats the boss, and then adjust your search range depending on the result. Within a logarithmic number of checks, you’ll find the exact threshold where the game flips from unwinnable to winnable."
